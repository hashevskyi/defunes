            <p>Louis de Funes was born on July 31, 1914, in Courbevoie, France,
        of Mediterranean ancestry. His father was a lawyer and diamond broker,
        and the young Funes was known for being a jokester, inspired by turmoil at home.
        He worked a variety of jobs during adulthood and was released from French military service
        during World War II due to a healh misdiagnosis.</p>
            <p>Funes entered the world of French film in the mid-1940s. Over the course of almost 20 years,
        he would be featured primarily as an extra or in supporting roles in dozens upon dozens works,
        including Antoine et Antoinette (1947), Ma Femme Est Formidable (1951) and Frou-Frou (1955).
        He also landed a prominent part as a butcher in the well-known La Traversee de Paris (1956).</p>
            <p>Funes performed as a pianist in Parisian cabarets as well and continued to develop his stagecraft,
        eventually earning raves for his performance in Oscar; the play was later turned into a 1967
        film for which Funes shared screenwriting credit.</p>
            <p>Though a luminary, Funes preferred the quiet life with his wife, Jeanne, and their two children.
        (Jeanne was also his agent, and son Olivier appeared in several films with his father.)
        Funes was also known for his love of rose gardening and organic farming.</p>
            <p>By the mid-1970s, Funes suffered from severe heart problems and had to curtail his work.
        He subsequently made a few more films, including La Zizanie (1978) and L'Avare (1979),
        which was directed by Girault and was a remake of a Moliere work.</p>
            <p>Funes received an honorary Cesar Award in 1980, presented by another comic icon, Jerry Lewis.
        Some time later, while at home, Funes suffered a heart attack and died at the age of 68 on January 27,
        1983, in Nantes, France.</p>
